Field Map, one-pager for (relational) Data Services on Azure:

- [Azure SQL]({% link pages/waf/azsql.md %})

## Why the name *Field Maps*? 
I am a GIS fan. ArcGIS launched an app called FieldMaps - its meaning and outcomes have been stuck with me for some time now. Some of its purpose included (a) enabling field teams, (b) access & streamline current data, and (c) Deploy quickly and easily. 

These exactly were the challenges I was having when it came to be skill ready or reference something quickly. One could mention Dictionary here - but it doesnt have a story, plus its not fun! For me, Field Maps is a quick & easy way of mapping out foundational and key references in easy to access form - plus they have to be current. <br><br>

## Field Map, or not, how it helps me? 
Key need is a ready-to-reference, easy-to-flow content as called out above. 
Longer version: Say when revisiting a product / tech: 
* If I start with Skilling site (like aka.ms/learn), I find that to too structured and sequential for my liking - plus the content wont present full depth of tech intesity. 
* If I go to product documentation - I generally is very widely spread (since its a documentation + reference for "everything"). Its too fine-grained and large in volume for me to pick/choose/step throuh. 
* Blogs can be another great choice. But I need to know who to read from - plus the content could still be dated beyond a limit. Not to mention, you still will have to reference back from Product Documentation if it indeed is the case "still". 

Field Map has the good balance - for me atleast. Am not influenced by interpretations. Its presented as a map instead, I can absorb the lay of the land, and start midway or begining. <br><br>

## How do I use these Field Maps? 
Start with any of the one-pager field maps linked above. Each has 
* Foundational topics mapped out, if you are just starting 
* References if you are in the Field and need to roll with some artefacts right away
* Five well architect framework related content. Go through them in presented order if you want to cover everything. Alternatively, feel free to jump onto specific pillar - perhaps as your conversation starter for problem/conversation at hand (and pull in other pillars eventually).

## Who owns these Field Maps? 
Legally - no body (or entity). I intend to keep these current to best I can (and shared here) – but I don’t intend to suggest these are owned. At best, I see them as pointer Product and Vendor knowledge - just catalogued differently so as to provide a convenient start line!

You are welcome to use these one-pagers as you see fit – for reference, exchange, circulation, baseline against etc. 
If you put in an attribution, hopefully more people might leverage these. But realistically I don’t have intentions (or time) to track them. My only request is to let me know if something's broken (or mislinked). As well (hoping its not just me who benefits), I will be joyous if you shared how these are of help to you.

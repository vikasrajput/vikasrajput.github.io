Field Map, one-pager for (relational) Data Services on Azure:

- [Azure SQL]({% link pages/waf/azsql.md %})

## Why the name *Field Maps*? 
I am a GIS fan. Maps and Fields have inspired me for years. Interestingly, among other vendors, ArcGIS have an app named FieldMaps which can help with (a) enabling field teams, (b) access & streamline current data, and (c) deploy quickly and easily. Similar were my challenges I was seeing when it came to being skill ready or to check something quickly. Dictionary can be quoted here - but it misses out on telling a story (and fun)! 

For me, Field Maps is a quick and easy way to map foundational topics (features in a field) and topics of specific interest as well architected framework pillars (think of them as layers) and some key bookmarks (as references).  <br><br>

## Field Map, or not, how it helps me? 
It helps you with ready-to-reference, easy-to-follow content as called out above. 
Longer version: When revisiting a product / tech:
* If I start with a “skilling” resource (say aka.ms/learn), I find them to be too structured and sequential - plus the content doesn’t represent full depth of tech intensity.
* If I go to Product Documentation – it’s generally spread out (since it’s a documentation + reference for “everything”). Fine-grained, and content volume can hinder the pace.
* Blogs are another great choice. But I need to know who to read - plus the content could still be dated. Not to mention, you might still check back with Product Documentation.
<br>
Field Map offers a good balance - for me at least. Am not influenced by interpretations. It’s presented as one pager map. And I can go deeper on topics straight from Product Documentation (mostly).  <br><br>

## How do I use these Field Maps? 
Start with any of the one-pager field maps linked above. Each has
* Foundational topics mapped out if you are just starting
* References if you are in the Field and need to roll with some artefacts right away
* Five well architect framework related content is presented in order if you want to cover everything. Alternatively, jump to a specific pillar - perhaps as your conversation starter for problem/conversation at hand (and pull in other pillars eventually).

## Who owns these Field Maps? 
Legally - no body (or entity). I intend to keep these current to best I can (and shared here) – but I don’t intend to suggest these are owned. At best, I see them as pointer to Product and Vendor Documentation / knowledge - just catalogued differently to provide a convenient start line!

You are welcome to use these one-pagers as you see fit – for reference, exchange, circulation, baseline against etc. If you put in an attribution, I would welcome that as it helps it reach more people. But beyond that, I don’t intend to track attributions. If possible, let me know if something’s broken (say, links). As well (hoping it’s not just me who benefits), I will be joyous if you shared how these are of help to you.

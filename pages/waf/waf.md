title: Well Architected Framework - Guiding Principles 
---

Well Architected Framework or WAF is a much wider topic. It has 5 (or 6 - if you consider AWS) pillars, with each being intepreted differently for nature of the service and scale of the solution. 

Intent of this article is to outline generic considerations to take in account, irrespective of individual Data Service (cloud or not). Its not meant to holistic for specific service, but is targetted at providing a baseline understanding for anyone starting new or anyone who doesnt indicate Tech as their primary role.

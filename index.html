<i>Why there is pain in this world? How does one be more happy? My very honest and humble perspective is - I don't know.
But you certainly are looking for something. Explains why you landed here - especially if we dont know each other. 

So I say (here we go!) - explore some data. And its applications - business apps, AI/ML. And then you automate it. 
May be you feel happy after that! Why I say this? Well, I needed an opening for this page - so be it! (happy?)

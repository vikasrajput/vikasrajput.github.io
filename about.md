For me, Data is at core of everything. It’s the ultimate storyteller. All we do is interpret it or miss capturing its value. 

For Data to stand the tests of time, I architect and manage delivery of resilient business solutions.  

Am a believer of Service Leadership. And Open Source. And [PEP 20: Zen of Python](https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/#the-zen-of-python){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} . 

Beyond work, I love spending time with my family, read and long walks. I cook - at times it all ending up in my plate!

Data is at core of everything and ultimate storyteller. 
All we do is mis/interpret it. 

To reach and persist: data depends on a strong architecture.
Frameworks, anti/patterns and *-as-code is the begining, not the end. 

At best, Tech is an enabler, a piece, a pie. 
Full circle needs People and Process too.

I architect, manage business solutions and platforms with data at their core, and Service Leadership as my way of execution. And some [Zen!](https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/#the-zen-of-python){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} . 


Beyond work, I love spending time with my family, reading, cooking and long walks.
